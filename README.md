*A game by Jack and John Polacek*


## Development Log

###*11-26-14*

Grant was asleep and I was working at home. Jack said that a while ago I told him that if he wanted to be able to make games he needed to know how to read. Now that he knows how to read, he wants me to teach him to program. I told him it wasn't quite that easy, but that we could work on a game together. 

I asked him what he wanted his game to be and here are my notes from what he said. He likes the Blocky Roads game so from what I can tell, that is his inspiration.

**Car**
- You can decorate it
- Drive around farmyard
- Press a button to make it go
- Only go straight.
- The car is named Syndro

**Obstacles**
- Hills
- Hot lava
- Ramps
- Parachutes if the car explodes
- Other cars that are damaged

**Buildings**
- You can click on a building to park on it
- Find stuff thats moving then unlock them in your farmyard

**Scenery**
- people walking by

**Other areas on the levels**

When we finished the intro screen, Jack asked me “Are we finished??”

I told him we were done with the first step. He asked how many steps there were. I said about a thousand. He was unfazed by this and excited to start the next step. Here are the steps we have so far:

- **Step 1** - Intro Screen (Jack picked the font)
- **Step 2** - Draw the car
- **Step 3** - Animate the car
- **Step 4** - Pick a Physics Engine - [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
- **Step 5** - Create game page with hello world example
- **Step 6** - Find car game example to use (found this [great tutorial!](http://www.inkfood.com/create-a-car-with-phaser/)

Worked on animating the car and separating it into pieces in Photoshop.
