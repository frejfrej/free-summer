*a game by Jack and John Polacek*


### Development Log
*11-26-14

Grant was asleep and I was working at home. Jack said that a while ago I told him that if he wanted to be able to make games he needed to know how to read. Now that he knows how to read, he wants me to teach him to program. I told him it wasn't quite that easy, but that we could work on a game together. 

I asked him what he wanted his game to be and here are my notes from what he said. He likes the Blocky Roads game so from what I can tell, that is his inspiration.

**Car**
- You can decorate
- Drive around farmyard
- Press a button to make it go
- Only go straight. Can go backwards
- The car is named Syndro

**Obstacles**
- Hills
- Hot lava
- Ramps
- Parachutes if the car explodes
- Other cars are damaged

**Buildings**
- You can click on a building to park on it
- Find stuff thats moving then unlock them in your farmyard

**Scenery**
- e walking by
-  areas on the levels
